**using house pricing machine learning and data science**

**ABSTRACT**

Machine Learning plays a virtual role from 
past years in normal speech command, product 
recommendation as well as in medical field also. 
Instead of this it provides better customer services 
and safer automobile system. This all of things shows 
that ML is trending technology in almost all fields so 
we are trying to coined up ML in our project. 
Nowadays the real estate market is a standout 
amongst the most focused regarding pricing and 
keep fluctuating. People are looking to buy a new 
home with their budgets and by analysing market 
strategies. But main disadvantage of current system 
is to calculate a price of house without necessary 
prediction about future market trends and result is 
price increase. So, the main aim of our project is to 
predict accurate price of house without any loss. 
There are many factors that have to be taken into 
consideration for predicting house price and try to 
predict efficient house pricing for customers with 
respect to their budget as well as also according to 
their priorities. So, we are creating a housing cost 
prediction model. By using Machine learning 
algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree 
Regression, K-Means Regression and Random 
Forest Regression. This model will help people to put 
resources into a bequest without moving towards a 
broker. The result of this research provide that the 
Random Forest Regression gives maximum 
accuracy.
